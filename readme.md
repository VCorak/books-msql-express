# My way to downfall project:  Connect database and build API

## MISSION 1

1. **Create database of favourite books in DataGrip**
    
### Obstacles on board: 
* made a nice table with favourite books, created id, name, author, genre and review part
* first I did not notice I have to add a password at all so Sicco had to intervene and remind me- had to change my actual password to new one because of...
* then I changed my mind and tried different approach with starting all over again

2. **Create API with express.js**

### Obstacles on board:

* figure out how to actually do it with having mysql on your way... ðŸ™„

## STEPS

1. Created structure of my project, boilerplate with directories and files
2. Connect server to port 3000 (should I create .env for password??)
3. Make a GitHub repo and commit so far# books-msql-express
